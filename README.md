Rock-Paper-Scissor Game using Python

This project focuses on the popular hand game known as Rock-Paper-Scissors, which originated in China. It involves two players competing against each other. During their turns, each player selects one option among Rock, Paper, and Scissors. The game is often used as a method of decision-making, similar to flipping a coin or rolling dice.

The game follows simple rules that determine the outcome:

Rock wins against Scissors.
Scissors win against Paper.
Paper wins against Rock.
If both players choose the same option, it results in a tie.

The main purpose of this project is to understand basic concepts of python.
